First it was Excel. Now Claude is coming to **PowerPoint**.

Anthropic just announced **Claude in PowerPoint** as a research preview, alongside substantial upgrades to Claude in Excel. This makes Claude significantly more capable for everyday work.

## What Claude in PowerPoint Can Do

Based on Opus 4.6's capabilities, expect Claude to help with:

### 🎨 Presentation Creation
Describe what you need, get a structured presentation with:
- Logical slide flow
- Key talking points
- Suggested visuals and layouts

### ✏️ Content Enhancement
- Refine messaging for clarity
- Suggest better phrasing
- Ensure consistency across slides

### 📊 Data Visualization
- Turn data into charts
- Recommend visualization types
- Create infographics from text

### 🔄 Format Conversion
- Convert documents to presentations
- Restructure existing decks
- Adapt content for different audiences

## Why This Matters

PowerPoint is ubiquitous in business. Everyone uses it, but few enjoy creating presentations. The pain points are real:

- **Starting from blank** is intimidating
- **Design consistency** is hard to maintain
- **Data visualization** requires expertise
- **Iteration** is time-consuming

Claude addresses all of these by bringing AI assistance directly into the workflow.

## The Bigger Picture: AI in Office

With Claude in Excel and now PowerPoint, Anthropic is building toward a comprehensive Office integration:

| Application | Status | Key Capabilities |
|-------------|--------|------------------|
| **Excel** | Available (upgraded) | Formulas, analysis, data cleaning |
| **PowerPoint** | Research Preview | Creation, design, content |
| **Word** | Coming soon? | Writing, editing, formatting |

## How It Compares

Microsoft has Copilot. Google has Gemini in Workspace. Now Anthropic brings Claude's unique strengths:

- **Opus-level reasoning** for complex presentations
- **Better at following instructions** than competing tools
- **1M context** for handling large content libraries
- **Thoughtful output** that matches professional standards

## Getting Access

Claude in PowerPoint is currently in **research preview**. Expect:
- Limited availability initially
- Feedback-driven improvements
- Gradual rollout to wider users

## Use Cases to Watch

### Sales Teams
Generate pitch decks from product specs and customer research.

### Executives
Create board presentations from lengthy reports and data.

### Consultants
Transform analysis into client-ready deliverables.

### Educators

## The Productivity Shift

The pattern is clear: AI is moving from standalone chat interfaces into the tools we already use. This reduces friction dramatically:

- No copy-pasting between apps
- Context stays in your workflow
- Results land where you need them

## What's Next

If the Excel experience is any indication, Claude in PowerPoint will:
1. Start with core capabilities
2. Add features based on user feedback
3. Become deeply integrated with Office workflows

The goal isn't to replace your skills—it's to amplify them. You bring the ideas; Claude handles the execution.
