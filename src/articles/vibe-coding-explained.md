Vibe coding is revolutionizing how we build software. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe the "vibe" you want, and AI makes it happen.

## The Traditional Way

Building a website traditionally requires:

- Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Understanding frameworks and libraries
- Setting up build tools and environments
- Hours of debugging and testing

This process takes weeks or months, even for experienced developers.

## The Vibe Coding Way

With vibe coding, you:

1. Describe what you want
2. AI generates the code
3. You refine with natural language
4. Ship in minutes

No programming knowledge required.

## Why "Vibe Coding"?

The term captures the essence of this approach: you're not writing code, you're conveying a *vibe*. You describe the feeling, the experience, the aesthetic - and AI translates that into working software.

### Examples of Vibe Coding Prompts

- "A landing page that feels modern and minimalist"
- "A dashboard with a corporate professional vibe"
- "An e-commerce site with playful, colorful energy"

## The Technology Behind It

Vibe coding platforms like Yomake use large language models trained on millions of websites and applications. They understand:

- Design patterns and best practices
- Modern frameworks and libraries
- Accessibility standards
- Performance optimization
