Creating a website has never been easier. With Yomake, you simply describe what you want, and our AI builds it for you. No coding required.

## What is Yomake?

Yomake is the #1 Vibe Coding Platform that lets you build websites and web apps using natural language. Instead of writing code, you describe your vision, and our AI handles the rest.

## Your First Website in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Describe Your Vision

Start by telling Yomake what you want to build. Be as specific or general as you like:

> "I want a portfolio website for a photographer with a dark theme, image gallery, and contact form."

### Step 2: Review and Refine

Yomake generates your website in seconds. Review the result and ask for changes:

- "Make the header sticky"
- "Add more spacing between sections"
- "Change the primary color to blue"

### Step 3: Deploy and Share

Once you're happy with your site, deploy it with one click. Yomake handles hosting, SSL, and everything else.

## Tips for Better Results

1. **Be specific about functionality** - Tell Yomake exactly what features you need
2. **Describe the style** - Mention colors, themes, and visual preferences
3. **Iterate quickly** - Don't be afraid to ask for changes
