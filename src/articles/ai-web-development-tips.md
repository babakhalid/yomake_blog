AI-powered web development is powerful, but knowing how to communicate with AI makes all the difference. Here are five tips to get better results.

## 1. Start with the Big Picture

Don't dive into details right away. Start with a high-level description:

**Good:** "A SaaS landing page for a project management tool"

**Better:** "A SaaS landing page for a project management tool targeting remote teams, with a modern design, hero section, features grid, pricing table, and testimonials"

The more context you provide upfront, the better the initial result.

## 2. Reference Real Websites

AI understands references. If you like a particular style, mention it:

- "Similar to the Notion landing page"
- "With a layout like Linear's homepage"
- "Inspired by Stripe's documentation"

This gives the AI a concrete starting point.

## 3. Be Specific About Interactions

Animations and interactions make websites feel polished. Don't forget to describe them:

- "Fade in elements as they scroll into view"
- "Smooth hover transitions on cards"
- "A sticky navigation that changes on scroll"

## 4. Iterate in Small Steps

Making multiple small changes is better than one massive revision:

Instead of: "Change everything - different colors, layout, and content"

Try:
1. "Change the primary color to purple"
2. "Increase spacing between sections"
3. "Make the hero text larger"

## 5. Think Mobile First

Always consider mobile responsiveness:

- "Make sure it looks good on mobile"
- "The navigation should collapse into a hamburger menu on small screens"
- "Stack the feature cards vertically on mobile"

## Bonus: Save Your Favorite Prompts

When you find prompts that work well, save them! Build a library of effective descriptions you can reuse and modify for future projects.
