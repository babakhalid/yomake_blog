Sixty seconds. That's all it takes to go from blank screen to live landing page using AI.

Not a template. Not a drag-and-drop approximation. A custom, professional landing page built exactly to your specifications—in the time it takes to make instant coffee.

Here's exactly how to do it.

## The 60-Second Challenge

I'm going to walk you through creating a complete landing page in under a minute using [Youmake](https://youmake.dev). Ready? Let's go.

### Second 0-15: Write Your Prompt

Navigate to [youmake.dev](https://youmake.dev) and type your description:

> "A SaaS landing page for an AI writing tool. Dark theme with purple gradients. Hero section with headline and email signup. Features grid with icons. Testimonial section. Pricing with three tiers. Footer with social links."

That's it. One prompt, one paragraph.

### Second 15-45: AI Builds

Hit enter and watch:

- Hero section materializes with compelling copy
- Feature cards populate with icons and descriptions
- Testimonials appear with photos and quotes
- Pricing table renders with tier comparison
- Footer fills with navigation and social links

The AI doesn't just place elements—it designs. Color harmony, spacing, typography, responsive layouts—all handled automatically.

### Second 45-60: Deploy

Click "Deploy."

SSL certificate provisions. CDN configures. DNS propagates.

**Your landing page is live.**

Share the URL. You're done.

## Real Prompts That Work

Here are battle-tested prompts for common landing page types:

### SaaS Product
> "A modern SaaS landing page with hero video background, animated feature highlights, customer logos bar, pricing comparison table, and email capture. Use blue-to-purple gradient accents on dark theme."

### Mobile App
> "An app landing page with floating phone mockup, App Store and Google Play buttons, feature carousel, user reviews, and download statistics. Bright, friendly design with rounded elements."

### Agency/Service
> "A professional agency landing page with portfolio showcase, team photos grid, client testimonials slider, services offered section, and contact form. Minimal design with lots of whitespace."

### Event/Launch
> "An event landing page with countdown timer, speaker lineup with photos, schedule accordion, early bird ticket pricing, and venue location map. Exciting design with bold typography."

### Personal/Creator
> "A creator landing page with newsletter signup hero, recent content grid, 'As Seen In' media logos, about section with photo, and social media links. Clean, personality-forward design."

## Why AI Landing Pages Convert Better

Speed isn't the only advantage. AI-generated landing pages often outperform human-designed ones:

### 1. Best Practices by Default
AI has learned from millions of high-converting pages. It knows:
- Where to place CTAs for maximum visibility
- How much copy is too much (or too little)
- Which layouts guide eyes naturally
- What trust signals matter most

### 2. Mobile-First Architecture
AI doesn't "add mobile support later"—it builds responsive from the start. Every element scales and reflows correctly.

### 3. Performance Optimization
Clean code, optimized assets, fast load times. No bloat, no legacy cruft.

### 4. A/B Testing at Scale
Create five variants in five minutes. Test headlines, layouts, color schemes—without designer bottlenecks.

## Advanced Techniques

Once you've mastered the basics, level up with these approaches:

### The Iterate-and-Refine Method

Start broad, then narrow:

1. **First prompt**: General structure and vibe
2. **Second prompt**: "Make the hero section more impactful"
3. **Third prompt**: "Add subtle scroll animations"
4. **Fourth prompt**: "Strengthen the CTA copy"

Each iteration takes seconds. In 5 minutes, you have a polished, refined page.

### The Competitor-Aware Approach

> "A landing page similar to [competitor] but with darker colors, more emphasis on security features, and a simpler pricing structure"

AI understands context and comparison.

### The Audience-Specific Method

> "A landing page targeting enterprise IT managers. Emphasize compliance, security certifications, and ROI metrics. Professional tone, not flashy."

Specify your audience; AI adjusts messaging and design.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Too Much in One Prompt
❌ "A landing page with hero, features, pricing, about, team, blog, careers, partners, integrations, documentation, support, and contact"

✅ "A focused landing page with hero, three key features, social proof, and clear CTA"

Start simple. Add sections later.

### Too Vague
❌ "A nice landing page"

✅ "A professional landing page for B2B software with dark theme and credibility focus"

Specificity gets results.

### Forgetting Mobile
❌ Assuming desktop-first

✅ "A landing page optimized for mobile with thumb-friendly buttons and fast loading"

Or just trust AI—it handles mobile by default.

## From Landing Page to Full Funnel

Your landing page is live in 60 seconds. But that's just the start. With [Youmake](https://youmake.dev), you can build the entire funnel:

- **Thank you page** after signup
- **Email sequence** landing pages
- **Feature-specific** deep-dive pages
- **Pricing** comparison pages
- **Case study** pages

Each takes another 60 seconds. In 10 minutes, you have a complete marketing funnel.

## Measuring Success

Once your landing page is live, track what matters:

### Core Metrics
- **Conversion rate**: Signups / Visitors
- **Bounce rate**: Single-page exits
- **Time on page**: Engagement indicator
- **Scroll depth**: Content consumption

### Optimization Loop
1. Deploy landing page
2. Drive traffic
3. Analyze metrics
4. Generate variant: "Same landing page but with shorter hero copy and more prominent CTA"
5. A/B test
6. Iterate

Traditional development makes this loop take weeks. With vibe coding, it's hours.
