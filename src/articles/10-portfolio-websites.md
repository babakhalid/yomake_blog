## Pro Tips for Portfolio Success

### Content Matters More Than Design
The best portfolio design can't save weak work. Curate ruthlessly—show only your best 6-10 projects.

### Tell Stories, Not Just Show Images
Explain the problem, your process, and the results. Context makes your work memorable.

### Make Contact Easy
Your portfolio's job is to get you hired. Don't bury the contact form.

### Mobile Matters
Most recruiters first see your portfolio on their phone. Test mobile responsiveness.

### Keep It Updated
A portfolio with projects from 3 years ago signals you've stopped growing.
